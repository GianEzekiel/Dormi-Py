## :mag_right: Significance

<p align = "justify"> This project is in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals(SDG) No.4, Quality Education. The students who have begun living in their own individual dormitories are the sole intended users of this project. This will help them to be more organized and responsible students while only living on their own far from their home. They will be able to manage their liabilities much more quickly and devote more time to their education as a result. Additionally,  attendance checkers are also included for additional security measures to know each user’s whereabouts. </p>
