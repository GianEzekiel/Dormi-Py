## :mega: Description and Purpose

<p align = "justify"> 
    The primary focus of this system is to assist students in maintaining a more organized and responsible lifestyle during their designated dormitory stay. The system     offers the following functions: 
</p>

***

### :hammer_and_wrench: User Accounts

<p align = "justify"> 
    Each individual will have their own account registered in the system, categorized as either Regular or Admin. 
</p>

- :student: Regular Account
    <p align = "justify"> 
        A regular account user will have access to all the functions provided by the system, which includes the liabilities checker, announcement tab, and attendance
        checker. 
    </p> 

- :office_worker: Administrator Account 
    <p align = "justify"> 
        As an administrator, in addition to the functions available to regular accounts, three additional functions will be provided. The first is the ability to post
        any information on the announcement tab, followed by the ability to modify the password verification. The third and final function is the ability to add or 
        remove liabilities in the liabilities checker. 
    </p> 

***

### :hammer_and_wrench: Liabilities Checker

<p align = "justify"> 
    This function provides a systematic approach for dormitories to manage their liabilities. The administrator can add or remove liabilities that are visible to every     account. Additionally, a page is included where each user can verify whether they have paid for a specific liability. Users cannot immediately uncheck their           liabilities; a prompt will ask for a password set by the administrator to confirm the validity of their payment. 
</p>

***

### :hammer_and_wrench: Announcement Tab

<p align = "justify"> 
    This function allows the administrator to make announcements that will be visible to all users upon successful publication. The announcements will be immediately  
    accessible to any user who logs in. 
</p>

***

### :hammer_and_wrench: Attendance Checker

<p align = "justify"> 
    This function provides a way to log the attendance of each user as they enter and leave the dormitory. The key features of this function are as follows: 
</p>

- :clock12: Time-in and Time-out
    <p align = "justify"> 
        Each user will be able to record the time they leave and re-enter the dormitory grounds. When they are about to time-out, a checklist of possible reasons for           leaving will prompt, and it will be saved along with the time-out record. All time-in and time-out records will be saved in the database. 
    </p> 

- :house: Who's Currently at Home? 
    <p align = "justify"> 
        In correlation with the feature mentioned above, this function allows all users to see the list of individuals who are currently inside the dormitory. Users           who are currently inside will appear as active, while those who are currently outside will appear as inactive. 
    </p>

## :mag_right: Significance

<img src="https://globalgoalscms.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png" align="left" width=130 height=125/>

<p align = "justify"> 
    This project is aligned with the fourth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Quality Education. The project's sole intended users are students who live in             individual dormitories. The project aims to assist them in becoming more organized and responsible while living far from their homes, allowing them to manage their     liabilities more efficiently and devote more time to their education. Furthermore, attendance checkers are included as an additional security measure to track the     whereabouts of each user.
